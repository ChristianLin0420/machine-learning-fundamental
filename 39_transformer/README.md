# Transformer (Encoder/Decoder)

## 📌 Overview
Implement the complete Transformer architecture from scratch including encoder-decoder structure with self-attention and cross-attention.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Multi-Head Self-Attention
- Positional Encoding
- Encoder-Decoder Architecture
- Feed-Forward Networks

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Scaled dot-product attention
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Positional encoding functions
- Complete encoder-decoder transformer

## 📊 Results
- Sequence-to-sequence translation tasks
- Attention weight visualizations
- Performance vs RNN/LSTM models
- Computational efficiency analysis
