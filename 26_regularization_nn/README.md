# Neural Network Regularization

## 📌 Overview
Implement regularization techniques for neural networks including dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay to prevent overfitting.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Dropout for Neural Networks
- Batch Normalization
- Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)
- Early Stopping

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Dropout layer implementation
- Batch normalization forward/backward pass
- Weight decay in optimizer
- Early stopping mechanism

## 📊 Results
- Overfitting prevention demonstration
- Training vs validation curves
- Batch normalization effect on training speed
- Dropout rate sensitivity analysis
