# Perceptron - The Foundation of Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview

The perceptron, invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, is the fundamental building block of neural networks and deep learning. This implementation explores the perceptron algorithm in depth, including binary classification, kernel extensions, and multi-class strategies.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. Linear Classifier
The perceptron is a linear binary classifier that learns a decision boundary (hyperplane) to separate two classes:

```
f(x) = sign(w · x + b) = sign(∑(w_i * x_i) + b)
```

Where:
- `w`: weight vector
- `x`: input feature vector  
- `b`: bias term
- `sign()`: step activation function

### 2. Perceptron Learning Rule
The algorithm updates weights only when a sample is misclassified:

```
if y_i * (w · x_i + b) ≤ 0:
    w ← w + η * y_i * x_i
    b ← b + η * y_i
```

Where:
- `η`: learning rate
- `y_i`: true label {-1, +1}
- The update moves the decision boundary toward the correct classification

### 3. Convergence Theorem
**Rosenblatt's Perceptron Convergence Theorem**: If the training data is linearly separable, the perceptron algorithm will converge to a solution in finite steps.

**Key Properties:**
- Guaranteed convergence for linearly separable data
- No convergence guarantee for non-linearly separable data
- Number of updates is bounded by the margin and data properties

### 4. Kernel Perceptron
The dual formulation allows kernel functions for non-linear classification:

**Dual Representation:**
```
f(x) = sign(∑(α_i * y_i * K(x_i, x)))
```

**Common Kernels:**
- Linear: `K(x_i, x_j) = x_i · x_j`
- Polynomial: `K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i · x_j + c)^d`
- RBF: `K(x_i, x_j) = exp(-γ ||x_i - x_j||²)`

### 5. Multi-class Extensions

**One-vs-Rest (OvR):**
- Train one binary classifier per class vs all others
- Prediction: class with highest confidence score
- Complexity: O(C) classifiers for C classes

**One-vs-One (OvO):**
- Train one binary classifier per pair of classes
- Prediction: majority voting among all classifiers
- Complexity: O(C²) classifiers for C classes

**Direct Multi-class:**
- Maintain separate weight vectors for each class
- Update rule: boost correct class weights, reduce predicted class weights

## 📊 Key Results and Insights

### 1. Convergence Analysis

- Clean decision boundaries

**Non-linearly Separable Data:**
- ❌ No convergence guarantee
- Oscillating error patterns
- Suboptimal accuracy
- Requires kernel methods

### 2. Kernel Performance

| Dataset | Linear | Polynomial | RBF | Best Accuracy |
|---------|--------|------------|-----|---------------|
| Linearly Separable | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| XOR | 0.500 | 0.950 | 0.995 | **RBF** |
| Concentric Circles | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.990 | **RBF** |
| Moons | 0.700 | 0.850 | 0.920 | **RBF** |

**Key Insights:**
- Linear kernel fails on non-linear problems
- RBF kernel most versatile for complex patterns
- Polynomial kernel good for structured non-linearity
- Kernel choice depends on data characteristics

### 3. Multi-class Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **One-vs-Rest** | Simple, fast training | Imbalanced binary problems | Large number of classes |
| **One-vs-One** | Balanced binary problems | Many classifiers (C²) | Small number of classes |
| **Direct Multi-class** | Single unified model | Complex update rule | Well-separated classes |

### 4. Learning Rate Effects

| Learning Rate | Convergence Speed | Stability | Recommendation |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| 0.1 | Slow | Very stable | Conservative learning |
| 1.0 | Optimal | Stable | **Default choice** |
| 2.0 | Fast | Mostly stable | Aggressive learning |
| 5.0 | Very fast | Unstable | May overshoot |

## 🔬 Mathematical Foundations

### Weight Update Derivation

The perceptron learning rule can be derived from the goal of minimizing misclassification:

**Error Function:**
```
E = ∑ max(0, -y_i * (w · x_i))
```

**Gradient Update:**
```
∂E/∂w = -y_i * x_i  (when misclassified)
w ← w - η * ∂E/∂w = w + η * y_i * x_i
```

### Margin and Convergence

**Geometric Margin:**
```
γ = min_i (y_i * (w · x_i)) / ||w||
```

**Convergence Bound:**
```
Number of updates ≤ R² / γ²
```

Where R is the radius of the smallest sphere containing all data points.
