# Decision Trees

## 📌 Overview
Implement decision tree algorithms for both classification and regression, understanding information gain and tree pruning techniques.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Information Gain and Entropy
- Gini Impurity
- Tree Construction Algorithm (ID3, C4.5, CART)
- Pruning Techniques (Pre-pruning, Post-pruning)

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Recursive tree building algorithm
- Split criteria calculation (Information Gain, Gini)
- Handling continuous and categorical features
- Tree visualization and interpretation

## 📊 Results
- Tree structure visualization
- Feature importance ranking
- Performance on classification/regression tasks
- Impact of pruning on model performance
