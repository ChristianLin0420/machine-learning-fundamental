# Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview
Implement various anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns and outliers in data using statistical and machine learning methods.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Statistical Methods (Z-score, IQR)
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Statistical outlier detection
- Isolation Forest algorithm
- One-Class SVM implementation
- LOF for local density-based detection

## 📊 Results
- Anomaly visualization in different dimensions
- ROC curves for detection performance
- Comparison of detection methods
- Real-world dataset applications
