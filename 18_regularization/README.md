## ðŸ“š Theoretical Background

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Linear Regression with Regularization

The general form of regularized linear regression:

```
Loss = MSE + Î» Ã— Penalty
```

Where:
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error (data fitting term)
- **Î» (alpha)**: Regularization strength parameter
- **Penalty**: Regularization term (L1, L2, or combination)

#### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

```
Loss_L1 = MSE + Î» Ã— Î£|Î²áµ¢|
```

**Properties:**
- Promotes sparsity (sets coefficients to exactly zero)
- Automatic feature selection
- Solution may not be unique
- Less stable than Ridge

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- L1 penalty creates diamond-shaped constraint regions
- Sharp corners promote sparsity

#### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

```
Loss_L2 = MSE + Î» Ã— Î£Î²áµ¢Â²
```

**Properties:**
- Shrinks coefficients uniformly
- Never sets coefficients to exactly zero
- Unique solution always exists
- More stable than Lasso

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- L2 penalty creates circular constraint regions
- Smooth boundaries lead to uniform shrinkage

#### ElasticNet

```
Loss_ElasticNet = MSE + Î» Ã— (Î± Ã— Î£|Î²áµ¢| + (1-Î±) Ã— Î£Î²áµ¢Â²)
```

Where:
- **Î± (l1_ratio)**: Mixing parameter between L1 and L2
- **Î± = 1**: Pure Lasso
- **Î± = 0**: Pure Ridge
- **0 < Î± < 1**: Combined penalty

**Properties:**
- Balances feature selection and coefficient stability
- Handles correlated features better than Lasso
- Tunable trade-off between sparsity and shrinkage

### Regularization in Logistic Regression

For classification problems:

```
Loss = LogLikelihood + Î» Ã— Penalty
```

**Parameter C in sklearn:**
- C = 1/Î» (inverse of regularization strength)
- Higher C = Less regularization
- Lower C = More regularization

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Regularization directly affects the bias-variance tradeoff:

```
MSE = BiasÂ² + Variance + Irreducible Error
```

- **No Regularization**: Low bias, high variance
- **High Regularization**: High bias, low variance
- **Optimal Regularization**: Minimizes total MSE

**Comprehensive Path Analysis:**
This six-panel visualization tracks how coefficients evolve with regularization strength using the diabetes dataset:

- **Top Left - Lasso Path**: Each colored line represents a different feature's coefficient. Notice how features are eliminated one by one as alpha increases (coefficients hit zero), demonstrating Lasso's feature selection property. The sharp transitions to zero are characteristic of L1 regularization.

- **Top Right - Ridge Path**: All coefficients shrink smoothly toward zero but never reach exactly zero. The curves are smooth and continuous, showing Ridge's uniform shrinkage property without feature elimination.

- **Middle Left - ElasticNet Path**: Combines characteristics of both Lasso and Ridge. Some features are eliminated (like Lasso) while others shrink gradually (like Ridge), providing a balanced approach.
