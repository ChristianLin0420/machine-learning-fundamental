# Polynomial Regression

## 📌 Overview
Extend linear regression to handle non-linear relationships by transforming features into polynomial terms.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Feature Engineering: Polynomial Features
- Overfitting and Underfitting
- Model Complexity vs. Generalization
- Regularization for High-Degree Polynomials

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Polynomial feature transformation
- Matrix formulation for higher-order terms
- Cross-validation for degree selection
- Regularization techniques (Ridge/Lasso)

## 📊 Results
- Polynomial curves fitted to data
- Comparison of different polynomial degrees
- Learning curves showing bias-variance tradeoff
- Validation performance metrics
