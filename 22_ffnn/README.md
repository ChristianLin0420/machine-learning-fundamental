# Feedforward Neural Network

## 📌 Overview
Implement a multi-layer feedforward neural network from scratch with multiple hidden layers for complex pattern recognition.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Hidden Layers and Universal Approximation
- Forward Propagation
- Non-linear Activation Functions

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Layer-wise matrix operations
- Forward propagation algorithm
- Weight initialization (Xavier, He)
- Network architecture design

## 📊 Results
- Classification on non-linearly separable data
- Hidden layer activation visualizations
- Network depth vs performance analysis
- Comparison with shallow models
