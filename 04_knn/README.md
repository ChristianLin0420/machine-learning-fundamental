# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📌 Overview
Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for both classification and regression tasks using distance-based predictions.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Instance-Based Learning (Lazy Learning)
- Distance Metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski
- Curse of Dimensionality
- Optimal K Selection

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Distance calculation functions
- Efficient neighbor search algorithms
- Majority voting for classification
- Weighted voting based on distance

## 📊 Results
- Decision boundaries for different K values
- Performance comparison across K values
- Computational complexity analysis
- Feature scaling impact visualization
