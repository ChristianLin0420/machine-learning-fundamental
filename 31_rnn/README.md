# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## 📌 Overview
Implement RNN from scratch to understand sequential data processing and the challenges of vanilla RNNs like vanishing gradients.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Sequential Data Processing
- Hidden State and Memory
- Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
- Vanishing Gradient Problem

## 🛠️ Implementation
- RNN cell forward pass
- Hidden state initialization
- BPTT algorithm implementation
- Gradient clipping for stability

## 📊 Results
- Sequence prediction tasks
- Hidden state visualization over time
- Gradient flow analysis
- Comparison with feedforward networks
