# Model-Based RL (World Models / Dreamer)

## 📌 Overview
Implement model-based reinforcement learning using world models and planning, including modern approaches like Dreamer for sample-efficient learning.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Environment Model Learning
- Planning with Learned Models
- World Models Architecture
- Dreamer Algorithm

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Environment dynamics model
- Planning algorithms (MCTS, random shooting)
- World model with VAE and RNN
- Dreamer implementation basics

## 📊 Results
- Sample efficiency vs model-free methods
- Model accuracy and planning quality
- Dreaming vs real experience comparison
- Computational overhead analysis
