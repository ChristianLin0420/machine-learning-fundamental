# Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
Implement linear regression from scratch using NumPy to understand the fundamental concepts of supervised learning.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Hypothesis: y = Wx + b
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimization: Gradient Descent
- Normal Equation (closed-form solution)

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Matrix-vector formulation
- Manual gradient computation
- Learning rate optimization
- Cost function visualization

## 📊 Results
- Fit line visualized on synthetic data
- Cost function convergence plots
- Performance metrics (R², RMSE)
