# DBSCAN Clustering

## 📌 Overview
Implement DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes and identifying outliers.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Density-Based Clustering
- Core Points, Border Points, and Noise
- Eps (neighborhood radius) and MinPts parameters
- Cluster connectivity and reachability

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Neighborhood search algorithms
- Core point identification
- Cluster formation through density connectivity
- Noise point detection

## 📊 Results
- Cluster visualization with arbitrary shapes
- Outlier detection results
- Parameter sensitivity analysis (eps, min_samples)
- Comparison with K-means on non-spherical data
