# Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

## 📌 Overview
Implement Hidden Markov Models for sequential data modeling, understanding state transitions and observation probabilities.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Hidden States and Observations
- Transition and Emission Probabilities
- Forward-Backward Algorithm
- Viterbi Algorithm for Decoding

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Forward algorithm for likelihood computation
- Backward algorithm for smoothing
- Viterbi algorithm for most likely state sequence
- Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter learning

## 📊 Results
- State sequence prediction accuracy
- Parameter convergence visualization
- Applications to time series and NLP
- Comparison with other sequence models
