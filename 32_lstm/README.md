# Day 32: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the LSTM architecture, why it was created to solve the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs, and implement a comprehensive LSTM for sequence prediction tasks.

## 📚 Theory

### What is LSTM?
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), LSTMs solve the vanishing gradient problem that plagues standard RNNs.

### Why LSTM was Created
**Problems with Standard RNNs:**
- **Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients decay exponentially through time, preventing learning of long-term dependencies
- **Short Memory**: Unable to remember information over extended sequences
- **Training Instability**: Gradient explosion and poor convergence

**LSTM Solutions:**
- **Constant Error Carousel**: Cell state acts as a memory highway
- **Gated Architecture**: Controls information flow to prevent gradient decay
- **Selective Memory**: Learns what to remember, forget, and output

### LSTM Architecture Components

#### 1. Cell State (C_t)
The cell state acts like a conveyor belt, carrying information across time steps with minimal linear interactions.

#### 2. Hidden State (h_t)
The filtered version of cell state that serves as the output at each time step.

#### 3. Three Gates (Sigmoid activations ∈ [0,1])

**Forget Gate (f_t)**: Decides what information to discard from cell state
```
f_t = σ(W_f[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
```

**Input Gate (i_t)**: Decides what new information to store in cell state
```
i_t = σ(W_i[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
```

**Output Gate (o_t)**: Decides what parts of cell state to output
```
o_t = σ(W_o[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
```

#### 4. Candidate Values
New candidate values to be added to cell state:
```
C̃_t = tanh(W_C[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
```

#### 5. State Updates
**Cell State Update**:
```
C_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ C̃_t
```

**Hidden State Update**:
```
h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(C_t)
```

### Mathematical Foundation

The LSTM forward pass can be summarized as:
```
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)    # Forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)    # Input gate  
C̃_t = tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) # Candidate values
C_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ C̃_t       # Cell state
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)    # Output gate
h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(C_t)                  # Hidden state
```

Where:
- `σ` is the sigmoid function
- `⊙` denotes element-wise multiplication
- `[h_{t-1}, x_t]` is concatenation
- `W_*` are weight matrices, `b_*` are bias vectors

### Key Advantages of LSTM

1. **Long-term Memory**: Can remember information for hundreds of time steps
2. **Gradient Flow**: Constant error carousel prevents vanishing gradients
3. **Selective Processing**: Gates allow selective information retention
