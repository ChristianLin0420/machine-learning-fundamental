# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## 📌 Overview
Implement LSTM networks to solve the vanishing gradient problem of RNNs and enable learning of long-term dependencies.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Cell State and Hidden State
- Forget, Input, and Output Gates
- Gate Mechanisms and Sigmoid/Tanh Activations
- Long-term Dependency Learning

## 🛠️ Implementation
- LSTM cell with gate computations
- Forward pass through LSTM layers
- BPTT for LSTM training
- Sequence-to-sequence modeling

## 📊 Results
- Long sequence modeling performance
- Gate activation patterns
- Comparison with vanilla RNN
- Memory retention analysis
