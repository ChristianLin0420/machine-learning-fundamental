# Logistic Regression

## 📌 Overview
Implement logistic regression from scratch for binary classification problems using the sigmoid function and maximum likelihood estimation.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Sigmoid Function: σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))
- Log-Likelihood: Cost Function for Classification
- Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression
- Decision Boundary

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Sigmoid activation function
- Cross-entropy loss function
- Gradient computation for weights and bias
- Prediction probability and classification

## 📊 Results
- Decision boundary visualization
- Classification accuracy and confusion matrix
- Cost function convergence
- ROC curve and AUC
