# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 📌 Overview
Implement CNN from scratch to understand convolution operations, pooling, and hierarchical feature learning for image processing.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Convolution Operation and Filters
- Pooling Layers (Max, Average)
- Feature Maps and Hierarchical Learning
- Translation Invariance

## 🛠️ Implementation
- 2D convolution operation
- Pooling layer implementations
- CNN forward and backward pass
- Filter visualization techniques

## 📊 Results
- Image classification performance
- Learned filter visualizations
- Feature map activations
- Comparison with fully connected networks
