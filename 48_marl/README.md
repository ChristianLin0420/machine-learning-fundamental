# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## 📌 Overview
Explore multi-agent reinforcement learning where multiple agents learn and interact in shared environments with coordination and competition.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Multi-Agent Environments
- Independent Learning vs Centralized Training
- Nash Equilibrium in Games
- Cooperative vs Competitive Settings

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Multi-agent environment setup
- Independent Q-learning agents
- Centralized training with decentralized execution
- Communication protocols

## 📊 Results
- Agent coordination in cooperative tasks
- Competition dynamics analysis
- Emergent communication patterns
- Scalability with number of agents
