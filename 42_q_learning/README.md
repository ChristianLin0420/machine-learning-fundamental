# Q-Learning

## 📌 Overview
Implement Q-Learning algorithm for model-free reinforcement learning to find optimal action-value functions without knowing the environment model.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Q-Function (Action-Value Function)
- Temporal Difference Learning
- Exploration vs Exploitation (ε-greedy)
- Off-policy Learning

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Q-table initialization and updates
- ε-greedy exploration strategy
- Q-learning update rule
- Convergence analysis

## 📊 Results
- Learning curves on grid world
- Q-value heatmaps visualization
- Exploration strategy comparisons
- Performance on different environments
