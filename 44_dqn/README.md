# Deep Q-Network (DQN)

## 📌 Overview
Implement Deep Q-Network combining Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces like images.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Function Approximation with Neural Networks
- Experience Replay Buffer
- Target Network Stabilization
- Double DQN and Dueling DQN

## 🛠️ Implementation
- DQN neural network architecture
- Experience replay mechanism
- Target network updates
- Training loop with exploration

## 📊 Results
- Atari game performance
- Learning curves and stability
- Ablation studies (replay buffer, target network)
- Comparison with tabular Q-learning
