# Image Classification (MNIST)

## 📌 Overview
Build a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, implementing data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Image Data Preprocessing
- Flattening and Normalization
- Dense Neural Networks for Images
- Model Evaluation on Test Set

## 🛠️ Implementation
- MNIST data loading and preprocessing
- Multi-layer neural network architecture
- Training with validation monitoring
- Test set evaluation and visualization

## 📊 Results
- Training and validation accuracy curves
- Confusion matrix for digit classification
- Misclassified examples analysis
- Model performance metrics
