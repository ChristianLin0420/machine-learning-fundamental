# Day 40 — BERT Intro (Encoder-only Transformers, MLM Pretraining)

## 📌 Overview
A complete implementation of BERT from scratch, including the transformer encoder architecture and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining objective. This implementation demonstrates the core concepts behind bidirectional encoder representations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Model Components
- **BERT Encoder**: Multi-layer transformer encoder with pre-layer normalization
- **Embeddings**: Token + segment + positional embeddings
- **MLM Head**: Masked Language Modeling head with weight tying
- **Attention**: Multi-head self-attention with proper masking

### Key Features
- Bidirectional encoder representations
- Masked Language Modeling (15% masking: 80% [MASK], 10% random, 10% unchanged)
- Pre-layer normalization for training stability
- Weight tying between input embeddings and MLM head
- Custom tokenizer with subword support

## 🛠️ Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
conda activate ml
pip install torch transformers pyyaml tqdm
```

### Quick Training Run
```bash
# Simple training with working parameters
python simple_train.py
```

### Full Training Pipeline

python train_mlm.py \
    --config configs/bert_tiny.yaml \
    --corpus data/toy_corpus.txt \
    --output_dir ./checkpoints \
    --seed 42
```

### Model Evaluation
```bash
# Evaluate trained model (note: some compatibility issues with dataset format)
python evaluate_mlm.py \
    --checkpoint checkpoints/final_model.pt \
    --corpus data/toy_corpus.txt \
    --vocab checkpoints/vocab.json \
    --batch_size 8
```

### Testing Individual Components
```bash
# Test tokenizer
python -m tokenization.simple_wp

# Test dataset creation
python -m tokenization.dataset_mlm

# Debug training issues
python debug_train.py
```

## 📊 Results

### Training Performance (BERT-Tiny)
- **Architecture**: d_model=128, n_layers=2, n_heads=2, d_ff=256
- **Vocabulary**: 147 tokens
- **Sequence Length**: 64 tokens
- **Parameters**: 309,651 trainable parameters

#### Training Results:
```
Epoch 1: Loss = 20.41, MLM Accuracy = 10.98%
Epoch 2: Loss = 13.97, MLM Accuracy = 22.15%
```

✅ **Clear Convergence**: Loss decreased by 32%, accuracy doubled (2x improvement)

### Key Observations
- MLM loss decreases consistently showing the model learns to predict masked tokens
- MLM accuracy improves from random chance (~0.7%) to strong prediction (22%)
- Model successfully learns bidirectional representations from the toy corpus

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### Masked Language Modeling
- 15% of tokens are selected for masking
- 80% replaced with [MASK] token
- 10% replaced with random token  
- 10% kept unchanged
- Loss computed only on masked positions

### Transformer Architecture
- Pre-layer normalization (more stable than post-norm)
- Multi-head self-attention with proper padding masks
- GELU activation in feed-forward layers
- Residual connections around attention and FFN layers

### Embeddings
- **Token Embeddings**: Learned representations for each vocabulary token
- **Segment Embeddings**: Support for sentence pair tasks (though not used in MLM-only)
- **Position Embeddings**: Learned positional encodings (vs. sinusoidal)

### Training Stability
- Gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay
- Cosine learning rate schedule with warmup
- Custom collate function to handle sequence length consistency
- Robust sequence length management with assertions to prevent tensor size mismatches

## 🚀 Extensions & Improvements

## 🧠 Key Learnings

1. **Sequence Length Management**: Proper truncation and padding is critical for stable training
2. **Masking Strategy**: The 80/10/10 masking ratio is important for learning robust representations
3. **Architecture Choices**: Pre-layer norm improves training stability over post-layer norm
4. **Weight Tying**: Sharing weights between input embeddings and output projection reduces parameters
5. **Bidirectional Context**: BERT's bidirectional nature allows richer representations than unidirectional models
