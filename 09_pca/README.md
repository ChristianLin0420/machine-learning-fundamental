# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 📌 Overview
Implement PCA for dimensionality reduction by finding principal components that capture maximum variance in the data.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Covariance Matrix
- Variance Explained Ratio
- Dimensionality Reduction

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Data standardization and centering
- Covariance matrix computation
- Eigendecomposition
- Principal component selection

## 📊 Results
- Scree plot (explained variance ratio)
- 2D/3D visualization of transformed data
- Reconstruction error analysis
- Cumulative explained variance
