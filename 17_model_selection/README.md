# Model Selection & Cross-Validation

## 📌 Overview
Implement various model selection techniques and cross-validation strategies to choose the best model and avoid overfitting.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Train/Validation/Test Split
- K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Stratified Cross-Validation
- Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Cross-validation implementations
- Grid search for hyperparameter tuning
- Learning curves generation
- Model comparison frameworks

## 📊 Results
- Cross-validation score distributions
- Learning curves (training vs validation)
- Hyperparameter optimization results
- Model performance comparison
