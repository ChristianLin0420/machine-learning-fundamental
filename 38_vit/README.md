# Vision Transformer (ViT)

## 📌 Overview
Implement Vision Transformer to apply transformer architecture to computer vision tasks using patch-based image processing.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Image Patches as Sequences
- Patch Embeddings
- Position Embeddings for Images
- Self-Attention for Vision

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Image patch extraction and embedding
- Multi-head self-attention for images
- Transformer encoder for vision
- Classification head implementation

## 📊 Results
- Image classification performance vs CNNs
- Attention map visualizations
- Patch importance analysis
- Scaling behavior with dataset size
